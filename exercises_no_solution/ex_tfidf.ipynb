    "**Task:** Extend the code for the bag of words to TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors for a given set of documents. TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. This measure helps in identifying words that are unique and informative to a particular document while downweighting common words that appear across many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF consists of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Frequency (TF):** This component measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. It is calculated as the ratio of the count of a term in a document to the total number of terms in the document. TF is higher for words that occur more frequently within a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** This component measures the rarity of a term across the entire corpus of documents. It is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of the total number of documents to the number of documents containing the term, plus one. IDF is higher for terms that are rare across documents but present in only a few documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF(t) = log((1 + Total number of documents) / (1 + Number of documents containing term t))\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF score for a term in a document is obtained by multiplying its TF and IDF scores. This score reflects the importance of the term in the context of the document and the entire corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement functions `calculate_tf` and `calculate_idf` to calculate Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) respectively.\n",
    "- Write a `create_tf_idf` function to create TF-IDF vectors for a given set of documents. This function should count the frequency of each word in the corpus, calculate TF and IDF, and compute TF-IDF vectors for each document."
