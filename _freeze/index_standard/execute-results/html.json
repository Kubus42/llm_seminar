However, you should find everything we will do in the seminar also in this script. If there is something missing, I will make sure to include it as soon as possible, just give me a note. \n:::\n\n\n### What you will learn\nAs this seminar is meant to be an introduction to understanding and working with language models, so we can obviously not cover everything and offer deep insights into all the details. \nInstead, we aim to give you a simple overview of all the necessities to start working with language models APIs and understand why things are working the way they do and how you can apply them in your own applications. \nThe content can already be seen from the navigation bar, but here's a quick walk-through.\nMore precisely, we will walk you through a quick history of natural language processing with some of its challenges and limitations, and introduce you to text processing and analysis techniques such as tokenization, term frequency or bag of words as well as applications such as text classification or sentiment analysis.\nAfterwards, we will give a short introduction to how modern large language models approach these with more sophisticated techniques based on neural networks and vast amounts of training data, before getting more hands-on with the language model API by OpenAI.\nEventually, we will have a quick look into some other applications of embeddings, before quickly discussing some of the ethical considerations when working with language models.\nHave fun! \n\n\n### A rough schedule\n- Introduction & Getting to know each other & Survey (experiences & expectations) & Learning goals & Evaluation criteria\n- Introduction to the general topic & Python & Jupyter \n- Introduction NLP (tokenization, matching, statistical analysis)\n- Introduction to LLM & OpenAI API\n- Prompting\n- Embeddings\n- Advanced GPT topics (image data, parameterization, tool calling)\n- Real-world examples of applications (& implementation) & limitations\n- *App concept & Group brainstorming*\n- *Project work on prototype & mentoring*\n- *Project presentations* & reflections on the seminar\n- Backup: Ethics and data privacy \n\n\n#### After the seminar (~1d):\n  - Prototype refinement\n  - Code review & documentation\n  - Refine business case & potential applications of prototype\n  - Reflections & lessons learned\n→ *Hand in 2-page summary*\n\n\n### Evaluation\nAll seminar participants will be evaluated in the following way.\n\n- Your presentation on the last day of the seminar: 25%\n- Your prototype: 35%\n- Your summary: 25%\n- Your activity during the seminar: 15%\n\nI will allow myself to give your evaluation a little extra boost for good activity during the seminar. \nThis seminar is designed for everyone to participate, so the more you do, the more fun it will be! \n\n#### What is the summary? \nAs mentioned above, to finalize our seminar I want to you to take roughly a day to refine your prototype and then write a quick summary your project and your learnings.\nThe summary should be 2-3 pages only (kind of like a small executive summary) and contain the following information:\n- What is your prototype? What can I do? \n- What could be a business case for your prototype, or where can it be applied?\n- What are current limitations of your prototype and how could you overcome them?\n- What have been your main learnings during the creation of your prototype (and/or) the seminar itself?\n\nJust hand it in within a couple of weeks after the seminar, it will be a part of your evaluation.\n\n\n:::::: {.callout-note}\nHas this seminar been created with a little help of language models? Absolutely, why wouldn't it? :)\n:::\n\n",
