B\ny handling errors effectively, you can ensure the reliability and resilience of your application, minimizing disruptions to the user experience and maintaining smooth operation under varying conditions. \nImplementing proper error handling practices is essential for building robust and dependable applications that leverage the capabilities of the OpenAI Chat Completions API effectively.\n\n",
