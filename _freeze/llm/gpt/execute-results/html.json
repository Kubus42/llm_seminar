It belongs to the family of transformer-based models, which have revolutionized NLP in recent years. What distinguishes GPT from its predecessors (and the approaches we have discussed before) is its remarkable ability to understand and generate human-like text.\nOne key advantage of GPT over previous approaches lies in its architecture. \nThe transformer architecture, upon which GPT is built, introduces a novel mechanism called self-attention. \nThis mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence dynamically, capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information more effectively than earlier models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nAnother factor contributing to GPT's superiority is its scalability. \nBy leveraging the parallelism inherent in the transformer architecture, GPT can efficiently process and learn from vast amounts of data and hence allowing it to scale to unprecedented sizes. \nLarger models trained on more data tend to exhibit better performance, as being exposed to a diverse range of linguistic patterns and structures during training let's them capture more complex patterns and nuances in language.\nThe pre-training works in a similar fashion as we've already seen: GPT learns to predict the next word in a sequence given the preceding context. \nThis process enables it to capture the nuances of language across various domains and lets it generate coherent and contextually relevant text across a wide range of topics and writing styles.\n\n\n### What is a transformer?\n\nThe transformer architecture has been introduced in the landmark paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and revolutionized the way sequential data, like text, is processed and understood.\nAt the heart of the transformer architecture lies the so-called self-attention mechanism, which is a novel way of capturing the relationships between different elements in a sequence, i.e., individual words or tokens in a sentence.\nUnlike traditional architectures, where information flow is constrained by fixed-length context windows or recurrent connections, transformers enable each word in a sentence to attend to all other words simultaneously through self-attention.\n\nThis mechanism allows transformers to dynamically weigh the importance of each word in the context of the entire sequence. This means that words that are semantically related or have a strong contextual influence on each other will receive higher attention weights, while irrelevant or less informative words will receive lower weights. \nBy capturing these dependencies across the entire sequence, transformers excel at capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information, which is crucial for understanding and generating coherent text.\n\nA very important detail is that the self-attention mechanism enables transformers to process input sequences in parallel rather than sequentially, leading to significant computational advantages. \nUnlike RNNs, which process inputs one token at a time in a sequential manner, transformers can process all tokens in parallel, making them highly efficient and scalable, especially when dealing with long sequences or large datasets.\nThis parallelism not only speeds up training but also allows transformers to capture complex patterns and relationships in data more effectively. \n\n",
