Players make choices that influence the direction of the narrative.\n5. **Sentiment Analysis Tool**: Build an app that analyzes the sentiment of text inputs (e.g., social media posts, customer reviews) using GPT. Users can input text, and the app provides insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the text.\n6. **Text Summarization Tool**: Create an application that summarizes long blocks of text into shorter, concise summaries. Users can input articles, essays, or documents, and the tool generates a summarized version.\n7. **Language Translation Tool**: Build a simple translation app that utilizes GPT to translate text between different languages. Users can input text in one language, and the app outputs the translated text in the desired language. Has to include some nice tweaks.\n8. **Story Generation Game**: Develop a storytelling game where users provide prompts or keywords, and GPT generates a short story based on those inputs. Users can then rate the generated stories for creativity and coherence. \n9. **Question-Answering Chatbot**: Build a chatbot that can answer questions posed by users on a specific topic (e.g., based on documents). Users input their questions, and the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a pre-trained GPT model or specific documents). \n10. **Personalized Recipe Generator**: Develop an app that generates personalized recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions. Users input their preferred ingredients and dietary needs, and the app generates custom recipes using GPT.\n11. **Lyrics Generator**: Create a lyrics generation tool that generates lyrics based on user input such as themes, music style, emotions, or keywords. Users can explore different poetic styles and themes generated by GPT.\n12. **Text Summarizer**\n\n",
