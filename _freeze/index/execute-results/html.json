However, you should find everything we will do in the seminar also in this script. If there is something missing, I will make sure to include it as soon as possible, just give me a note. \n:::\n\n\n### What you will learn\nTODO: When finalized, do a quick summary here.\n\n\n### The schedule\nThis seminar is spread over 4 days of roughly 8 hours, of course with some breaks and modifications if we need them.\nThe schedule for this semester is the following (the included hours are just some estimations):\n\n#### Day 1 (24.04.2024):\n  - Getting to know each other + intro survey (experiences & expectations) (1h)\n  - Learning goals & final evaluation criteria (0.5h)\n  - Introduction & overview of the topic (0.5h)\n  - Introduction to natural language processing & setup of the development environment (4h)\n  - Introduction to LLM & getting to know the OpenAI API: Part 1 (2h)\n\n#### Day 2 (25.04.2024):\n  - Introduction to LLM & getting to know the OpenAI API: Part 2 (3h)\n  - Prompting (1h)\n  - Embeddings (2h)\n  - Group brainstorming session: Designing a simple app concept involving GPT (2h)\n  \n→ At home until next week: refine project ideas (1h)\n\n#### Day 3 (30.04.2024):\n  - Advanced GPT-related topics (1h)\n  - Business-related topics (1h)\n  - Team building for hackathon → develop app concepts (1h)\n  - Work on prototypes (5h)\n\n#### Day 4 (02.05.2024):\n  - Final touches for the prototypes (3h)\n  - Presentation of app prototypes, peer feedback & evaluation (2h)\n  - Reflections on the seminar (1h)\n  - Ethics & data privacy considerations (backup)\n\n#### After the seminar (~1d):\n  - Prototype refinement\n  - Code review & documentation\n  - Refine business case & potential applications of prototype\n  - Reflections & lessons learned\n→ *Hand in 2-page summary*\n\n\n### Evaluation\nAll seminar participants will be evaluated in the following way.\n\n- Your presentation on the last day of the seminar: 25%\n- Your prototype: 35%\n- Your summary: 25%\n- Your activity during the seminar: 15%\n\nI will allow myself to give your evaluation a little extra boost for good activity during the seminar. \nThis seminar is designed for everyone to participate, so the more you do, the more fun it will be! \n\n#### What is the summary? \nAs mentioned above, to finalize our seminar I want to you to take roughly a day to refine your prototype and then write a quick summary your project and your learnings.\nThe summary should be 2-3 pages only (kind of like a small executive summary) and contain the following information:\n- What is your prototype? What can I do? \n- What could be a business case for your prototype, or where can it be applied?\n- What are current limitations of your prototype and how could you overcome them?\n- What have been your main learnings during the creation of your prototype (and/or) the seminar itself?\n\nJust hand it in within a couple of weeks after the seminar, it will be a part of your evaluation.\n\n\n:::::: {.callout-note}\nHas this seminar been created with a little help of language models? Absolutely, why wouldn't it? :)\n:::\n\n",
