Since `x` is 10, which is greater than 5, the print statement is executed.\n\n\n\n## The `else` Statement\n\nYou can use the `else` statement to define what happens if the condition in the `if` statement is **False**. \nThe `else` block will run when all previous conditions are false.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#54bcf190 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 3\nif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not greater than 5\")  # Output: x is not greater than 5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx is not greater than 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, since `x` is 3 (which is not greater than 5), the `else` block is executed, and the message \"x is not greater than 5\" is printed.\n\n\n\n## The `elif` Statement\n\nIf you want to check multiple conditions, you can use `elif` (short for \"else if\"). \nThe `elif` statement allows you to test additional conditions if the previous `if` condition was False.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#48aa8c43 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 7\nif x > 10:\n    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\nelif x > 5:\n    print(\"x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10\")  # Output: x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10\nelse:\n    print(\"x is less than or equal to 5\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, Python first checks if `x > 10`. Since that condition is false, it moves to the `elif` condition (`x > 5`), which is true, so the second block is executed.\n\n\n\n### Using Comparison Operators\n\nIn conditional statements, we typically use **comparison operators** to evaluate the relationship between values. \nHere are some common comparison operators:\n\n- `==`: Equal to\n- `!=`: Not equal to\n- `>`: Greater than\n- `<`: Less than\n- `>=`: Greater than or equal to\n- `<=`: Less than or equal to\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#54fe6687 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nage = 18\n\nif age == 18:\n    print(\"You are 18 years old\")  # Output: You are 18 years old\nif age != 20:\n    print(\"You are not 20 years old\")  # Output: You are not 20 years old\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nYou are 18 years old\nYou are not 20 years old\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we use the `==` operator to check if `age` is exactly 18 and the `!=` operator to check if `age` is not 20.\n\n\n\n### Logical Operators\n\nPython also provides **logical operators** to combine multiple conditions:\n\n- `and`: Returns **True** if both conditions are true.\n- `or`: Returns **True** if at least one condition is true.\n- `not`: Inverts the truth value of the condition.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#cee6ae01 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 7\n\n# Using 'and' operator\nif x > 5 and x < 10:\n    print(\"x is between 5 and 10\")  # Output: x is between 5 and 10\n\n# Using 'or' operator\nif x < 5 or x > 6:\n    print(\"x is either less than 5 or greater than 6\")  # Output: x is either less than 5 or greater than 6\n\n# Using 'not' operator\nif not x == 5:\n    print(\"x is not equal to 5\")  # Output: x is not equal to 5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx is between 5 and 10\nx is either less than 5 or greater than 6\nx is not equal to 5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, the `and` operator checks if both conditions (`x > 5` and `x < 10`) are true, the `or` operator checks if at least one condition is true, and the `not` operator inverts the condition, making `x == 5` false.\n\n\n\n### Nested `if` Statements\n\nYou can place an `if` statement inside another `if` statement. This is called **nesting** and is useful when you need to check multiple conditions that depend on each other.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#b43d150c .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 10\ny = 20\n\nif x > 5:\n    if y > 15:\n        print(\"x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 15\")  # Output: x is greater than 5 and y is greater than 15\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nx is greater than 5 and y is greater than 15\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we first check if `x > 5`. Since this is true, we then check if `y > 15`. Since both conditions are true, the inner block is executed.\n\n\n### Checking Membership with `in` Operator\n\nThe `in` operator is used to check if a value is present in a collection like a list, string, or tuple. This is particularly useful in NLP tasks when checking if a word or character exists in a string or list.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#b00b7279 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nif \"banana\" in fruits:\n    print(\"Banana is in the list!\")  # Output: Banana is in the list!\n\n# Checking a string\nsentence = \"Hello world\"\nif \"world\" in sentence:\n    print(\"The word 'world' is in the sentence.\")  # Output: The word 'world' is in the sentence.\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nBanana is in the list!\nThe word 'world' is in the sentence.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we use the `in` operator to check whether `\"banana\"` is present in the `fruits` list and if the word `\"world\"` is in the `sentence`.\n\n\n\n### Combining Conditions in Practical Examples\n\nLet’s take an example where we check whether a user’s input meets certain conditions, like a password validation function.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#36c0a049 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\npassword = \"Hello123\"\n\nif len(password) >= 8 and any(char.isdigit() for char in password):\n    print(\"Password is valid\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain a number.\")\n# Output: Password is valid\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPassword is valid\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we check two conditions for the password: it should be at least 8 characters long and must contain a number. \nThe function `char.isdigit()` checks if there’s any numeric character in the password.\n\n\n\n### Edge Cases and Handling Errors\n\nWhen using conditional statements, it’s important to think about edge cases, i.e., situations where input values might behave differently or cause errors. \nFor example, when dealing with empty strings, null values, or division by zero, you should handle these cases appropriately using conditionals.\n\n#### Example:\n\n::: {#7517b18d .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Checking for division by zero\nnumerator = 10\ndenominator = 0\n\nif denominator != 0:\n    result = numerator / denominator\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")  # Output: Cannot divide by zero\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCannot divide by zero\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we use a conditional statement to prevent a division by zero error by checking if the denominator is not zero before performing the division.\n\n",
