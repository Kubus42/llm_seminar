- **Temperature**: Temperature is a parameter that controls the randomness of the generated text. Lower temperatures result in more deterministic outputs, where the model tends to choose the most likely tokens at each step. Higher temperatures introduce more randomness, allowing the model to explore less likely tokens and produce more creative outputs. It's often used to balance between generating safe, conservative responses and more novel, imaginative ones.

- **Max Tokens**: Max Tokens limits the maximum length of the generated text by specifying the maximum number of tokens (words or subwords) allowed in the output. This parameter helps to control the length of the response and prevent the model from generating overly long or verbose outputs, which may not be suitable for certain applications or contexts.

- **Top P (Nucleus Sampling)**: Top P, also known as nucleus sampling, dynamically selects a subset of the most likely tokens based on their cumulative probability until the cumulative probability exceeds a certain threshold (specified by the parameter). This approach ensures diversity in the generated text while still prioritizing tokens with higher probabilities. It's particularly useful for generating diverse and contextually relevant responses.

- **Frequency Penalty**: Frequency Penalty penalizes tokens based on their frequency in the generated text. Tokens that appear more frequently are assigned higher penalties, discouraging the model from repeatedly generating common or redundant tokens. This helps to promote diversity in the generated text and prevent the model from producing overly repetitive outputs.

- **Presence Penalty**: Presence Penalty penalizes tokens that are already present in the input prompt. By discouraging the model from simply echoing or replicating the input text, this parameter encourages the generation of responses that go beyond the provided context. It's useful for generating more creative and novel outputs that are not directly predictable from the input.

- **Stop Sequence**: Stop Sequence specifies a sequence of tokens that, if generated by the model, signals it to stop generating further text. This parameter is commonly used to indicate the desired ending or conclusion of the generated text. It helps to control the length of the response and ensure that the model generates text that aligns with specific requirements or constraints.

- **Repetition Penalty**: Repetition Penalty penalizes repeated tokens in the generated text by assigning higher penalties to tokens that appear multiple times within a short context window. This encourages the model to produce more varied outputs by avoiding unnecessary repetition of tokens. It's particularly useful for generating coherent and diverse text without excessive redundancy.

- **Length Penalty**: Length Penalty penalizes the length of the generated text by applying a penalty factor to longer sequences. This helps to balance between generating concise and informative responses while avoiding excessively long or verbose outputs. Length Penalty is often used to control the length of the generated text and ensure that it remains coherent and contextually relevant.
