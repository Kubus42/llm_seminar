- **Definition of Large Language Models**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. They use advanced techniques such as Transformers and self-attention mechanisms to process and generate sequences of words.
- **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: LLMs are typically pre-trained on large text corpora using unsupervised learning techniques, where they learn the statistical properties of natural language. After pre-training, they can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains with labeled data to adapt their knowledge and capabilities.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Transformers are the backbone of LLMs, consisting of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. They excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for NLP tasks.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Self-attention allows LLMs to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence based on its relationship with other words in the sequence. This mechanism enables them to capture contextual information effectively and generate coherent text.
