Players make choices that influence the direction of the narrative.\nSentiment Analysis Tool: Build an app that analyzes the sentiment of text inputs (e.g., social media posts, customer reviews) using GPT. Users can input text, and the app provides insights into the overall sentiment expressed in the text.\nText Summarization Tool: Create an application that summarizes long blocks of text into shorter, concise summaries. Users can input articles, essays, or documents, and the tool generates a summarized version.\nLanguage Translation Tool: Build a simple translation app that utilizes GPT to translate text between different languages. Users can input text in one language, and the app outputs the translated text in the desired language. Has to include some nice tweaks.\nStory Generation Game: Develop a storytelling game where users provide prompts or keywords, and GPT generates a short story based on those inputs. Users can then rate the generated stories for creativity and coherence.\nQuestion-Answering Chatbot: Build a chatbot that can answer questions posed by users on a specific topic (e.g., based on documents). Users input their questions, and the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a pre-trained GPT model or specific documents).\nPersonalized Recipe Generator: Develop an app that generates personalized recipes based on user preferences and dietary restrictions. Users input their preferred ingredients and dietary needs, and the app generates custom recipes using GPT.\nLyrics Generator: Create a lyrics generation tool that generates lyrics based on user input such as themes, music style, emotions, or keywords. Users can explore different poetic styles and themes generated by GPT.\nText Summarizer",

    "text": "Word Embeddings: Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space. Each word is mapped to a high-dimensional vector where words with similar meanings or contexts are closer together in the vector space.\nContextual Embeddings: Contextual embeddings, also known as contextualized word embeddings, capture the contextual information of words based on their surrounding context in a given sentence or document. Unlike traditional word embeddings, contextual embeddings vary depending on the context in which a word appears.\nBERT Embeddings: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) embeddings are contextual embeddings provided by OpenAI. They are generated by pre-training a Transformer-based neural network model on a large corpus of text data using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction tasks.\nGPT Embeddings: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) embeddings are also contextual embeddings provided by OpenAI. They are generated by pre-training a Transformer-based neural network model on a large corpus of text data using an autoregressive language modeling objective.\nTransformer-based Architecture: Both BERT and GPT embeddings are derived from Transformer-based architectures, which consist of multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. These architectures excel at capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information in sequential data.\nPre-trained Models: OpenAI provides pre-trained BERT and GPT models that have been trained on large-scale text corpora. These pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains with labeled data to adapt their knowledge and capabilities to new applications.\nTransfer Learning: BERT and GPT embeddings support transfer learning, where the pre-trained models are used as feature extractors for downstream NLP tasks. By fine-tuning these models on task-specific data, users can leverage the knowledge encoded in the embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing tasks.\nApplications: BERT and GPT embeddings have a wide range of applications in natural language processing tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, question-answering, and more. They provide powerful representations of text data that capture both semantic and syntactic information.",

The two plots below should produce a figure with a red background. There should be no yellow figure.\n\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.rcParams.update({'figure.facecolor': 'red',\n                            'savefig.facecolor': 'yellow'})\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot([3, 2, 1])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 16 - Events\nPressing any keyboard key or mouse button (or scrolling) should cycle the line while the figure has focus. The figure should have focus by default when it is created and re-gain it by clicking on the canvas. Clicking anywhere outside of the figure should release focus, but moving the mouse out of the figure should not release focus.\n\nimport itertools\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nx = np.linspace(0,10,10000)\ny = np.sin(x)\nln, = ax.plot(x,y)\nevt = []\ncolors = iter(itertools.cycle(['r', 'g', 'b', 'k', 'c']))\ndef on_event(event):\n    if event.name.startswith('key'):\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.key))\n    elif event.name == 'scroll_event':\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.step))\n    else:\n        fig.suptitle('%s: %s' % (event.name, event.button))\n    evt.append(event)\n    ln.set_color(next(colors))\n    fig.canvas.draw()\n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_release_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('scroll_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_press_event', on_event)\nfig.canvas.mpl_connect('key_release_event', on_event)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 17 - Timers\nSingle-shot timers follow a completely different code path in the nbagg backend than regular timers (such as those used in the animation example above.) The next set of tests ensures that both “regular” and “single-shot” timers work properly.\nThe following should show a simple clock that updates twice a second:\n\nimport time\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\n\ndef update(text):\n    text.set(text=time.ctime())\n    text.axes.figure.canvas.draw()\n    \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\ntimer.start()\nplt.show()\n\nHowever, the following should only update once and then stop:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center') \ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\n\nplt.show()\n\nAnd the next two examples should never show any visible text at all:\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\ntext = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, '', ha='center')\ntimer = fig.canvas.new_timer(500, [(update, [text], {})])\n\ntimer.single_shot = True\ntimer.start()\ntimer.stop()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nUAT 18 - stopping figure when removed from DOM\nWhen the div that contains from the figure is removed from the DOM the figure should shut down it’s comm, and if the python-side figure has no more active comms, it should destroy the figure. Repeatedly running the cell below should always have the same figure number\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(5))\nplt.show()\n\nRunning the cell below will re-show the figure. After this, re-running the cell above should result in a new figure number.\n\nfig.canvas.manager.reshow()\n\n\n\nUAT 19 - Blitting\nClicking on the figure should plot a green horizontal line moving up the axes.\n\nimport itertools\n\ncnt = itertools.count()\nbg = None\n\ndef onclick_handle(event):\n    \"\"\"Should draw elevating green line on each mouse click\"\"\"\n    global bg\n    if bg is None:\n        bg = ax.figure.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) \n    ax.figure.canvas.restore_region(bg)\n\n    cur_y = (next(cnt) % 10) * 0.1\n    ln.set_ydata([cur_y, cur_y])\n    ax.draw_artist(ln)\n    ax.figure.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], 'r')\nln, = ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 0], 'g', animated=True)\nplt.show()\nax.figure.canvas.draw()\n\nax.figure.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick_handle)"
