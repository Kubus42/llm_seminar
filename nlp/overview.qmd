## Classic NLP tasks/applications

#### Part-of-Speech Tagging
Part-of-speech tagging involves labeling each word in a sentence with its corresponding grammatical category, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. 
For example, in the sentence "The cat is sleeping," part-of-speech tagging would identify "cat" as a noun and "sleeping" as a verb. 
This task is crucial for many NLP applications, including language understanding, information retrieval, and machine translation. 
Accurate part-of-speech tagging lays the foundation for deeper linguistic analysis and improves the performance of downstream tasks.

```{python}
import spacy

# Load the English language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Example text
text = "The sun sets behind the mountains, casting a golden glow across the sky."

# Process the text with spaCy
doc = nlp(text)

# Find the maximum length of token text and POS tag
max_token_length = max(len(token.text) for token in doc)
max_pos_length = max(len(token.pos_) for token in doc)

# Print each token along with its part-of-speech tag
for token in doc:
    print(f"Token: {token.text.ljust(max_token_length)} | POS Tag: {token.pos_.ljust(max_pos_length)}")
```
</details>



#### Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves identifying and classifying named entities in text, such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and more. For instance, in the sentence "Apple is headquartered in Cupertino," NER would identify "Apple" as an organization and "Cupertino" as a location. 
NER is essential for various applications, including information retrieval, document summarization, and question-answering systems. Accurate NER enables machines to extract meaningful information from unstructured text data.
