## About the seminar
- Roughly divided into 3 parts: **theory**, **training**, and **application**
- **Theory**:
  - Learn about important topics in natural language processing
  - Topics include tokenization, matching, statistical text analysis, language models, and embeddings
  - Coding examples in Python alongside theoretical concepts

---

- **Training**:
  - Hands-on exercises after each topic
  - Solve coding exercises to consolidate knowledge
  - Utilize Jupyterlab environment for exercises

&nbsp;

- **Application**:
  - Apply knowledge in own projects
  - Teams of 2-3 develop and implement prototypes
  - Small application involving a language model


## Goal
- 4-day introduction to language models
- Aim: Simple overview to start working with language model APIs
- Understand basics, know how to apply in own applications
- **Have fun!**


## Content 1
- Quick overview of classic NLP 
  - Text processing (Tokenization, Lemmatization, etc.)
  - Applications (Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Matching, etc.)
  - Challenges
- Introduction to LLM 
  - Text processing with neural networks
  - Sequence generation & language modeling

## Content 2
- Introduction to the OpenAI API

- Reflections on the seminar (1h)
- Ethics & data privacy considerations (backup)

## After the seminar (~1d):
- Prototype refinement
- Code review & documentation
- Refine business case & potential applications of prototype
- Reflections & lessons learned
→ *Hand in 2-page summary*


## Evaluation
- Your presentation on the last day of the seminar: 25%
- Your prototype: 35%
- Your summary: 25%
- Your activity during the seminar: 15%

## What is the summary? 
- 2-3 pages only!
- What is your prototype? What can I do? 
- What could be a business case for your prototype, or where can it be applied?
- What are current limitations of your prototype and how could you overcome them?
- What have been your main learnings during the creation of your prototype (and/or) the seminar itself?


# Code, Exercises & Prototypes

## Jupyterlab & Exercises
&nbsp;

### Jupyterlab
To get started right away, we have prepared a [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.fh-muenster.de/){.external}! 

&nbsp;

### Exercises
